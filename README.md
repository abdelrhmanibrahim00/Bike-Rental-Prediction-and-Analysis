# Bike Rental Prediction and Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of bike rental predictions using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. The goal is to predict the number of rented bikes based on environmental features such as temperature, humidity, season, wind speed, etc. The task also explores the incorporation of interaction effects between different features to see how they improve the model's performance.

## Overview

The project follows a structured process to analyze the bike rental problem and evaluate the effect of interaction terms on the model. The process includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Transformation**: Preparing the dataset for training.
2. **Model Building**: Fitting linear regression models with and without interaction effects.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using the R² metric.
4. **Interaction Effects Analysis**: Analyzing the effect of feature interactions on model performance.
5. **Results and Visualization**: Summarizing the results and visualizing the performance of models with and without interaction effects.

## 1. Data Preprocessing and Transformation

The first step in the analysis is to prepare the data for modeling. The dataset includes several environmental features (e.g., temperature, humidity, season) and the target variable (the number of bike rentals). In this stage, the following steps were carried out:

- **Log Transformation**: The target variable (`Rented Bike Count`) was log-transformed to address skewness and make the distribution more normal.
- **Feature Selection**: Relevant features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and seasonal data were selected for the model.
- **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Categorical variables like seasons were encoded into dummy variables to use in the model.

## 2. Model Building

After preprocessing the data, the next step is to build the linear regression model. The model is trained using the transformed dataset, with the R² score calculated to evaluate the model's fit. The model is evaluated by comparing predicted values to actual values.

- **Linear Regression Model**: A basic linear regression model is fit to the data without any interaction terms.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using the R² score, which indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

## 3. Interaction Effects

Interaction effects refer to scenarios where the combined effect of two features on the target variable is different from the sum of their individual effects. This project introduces interaction terms between pairs of features to see if they improve the model's performance. The following steps are involved:

- **Selection of Feature Pairs**: Several pairs of features were selected based on domain knowledge, including combinations of numerical and categorical variables.
- **Interaction Term Creation**: Interaction terms were created for the selected feature pairs using mathematical transformations (e.g., polynomial features).

## 4. Model Evaluation

To assess the impact of interaction effects, two models were trained for each interaction pair:
1. **Base Model**: The linear regression model using only the selected features without interaction terms.
2. **Model with Interaction**: The linear regression model using the selected features along with their interaction term.

Both models are evaluated using the **R² score** to measure their ability to explain the variance in the target variable. The model with the higher R² score indicates a better fit to the data.

## 5. Results and Analysis

The results from the models with and without interaction effects are compared in terms of the R² score. A summary table is provided to show the comparison of the models' performance with and without interaction terms. 

- **Impact of Interaction Effects**: Including interaction terms typically leads to a higher R² score, suggesting that the interaction between features improves the model's performance.
- **Visualization**: The results are visualized using bar charts to illustrate the difference in performance between the models with and without interaction effects.
